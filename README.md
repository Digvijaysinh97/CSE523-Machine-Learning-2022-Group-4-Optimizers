Volatility is the backbone of finance because it serves as both an information signal for investors and an input to various financial models. 
What is the significance of volatility? The response emphasizes the significance of uncertainty, which is a key feature of the financial model. 
Increased financial market integration has resulted in protracted market uncertainty, emphasizing the relevance of volatility, 
or the rate at which the value of financial assets changes. Volatility, which is utilized as a proxy for risk in many domains, 
including asset pricing and risk management, is one of the most significant variables.
Modeling is even required because of its substantial presence and delay. Following the Basel Accord, which went into effect in 1996,
volatility has become a major risk measure in risk management (Karasan and Gaygisiz 2020). Modeling volatility is the same as modeling uncertainty, 
and it allows us to better comprehend and approach uncertainty, allowing us to get close enough to the real world. 
We need to calculate the return volatility, also known as realized volatility, to see how well proposed models account for the real-world situation. 
The square root of the realized variance, which is the total of squared returns, 
is realized volatility. The performance of the volatility prediction approach is calculated using realized volatility.
